ENGO 551 - Adv. Topics on Geospatial Technologies

In Lab0, I created a website based around getting to know me better. The website has 4 other pages that are link through a hyperlink. Each link takes you to a different section. These sections include: Hobbies, Family and Friends, Future, and Learnings. Contained in this folder also is multiple stylesheets that i used to style the different pages. The files are all coded using html code and CSS properties and functions. Functions such as: lists, table, hyperlinks, images, media queries, selectors, bootstrap, variables, nesting, and SCSS inheritance.
