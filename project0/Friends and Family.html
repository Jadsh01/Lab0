            <p style="color:;text-align:center;"> Jad grew up with 3 brothers and 1 sister. While growing up he shared a room with his sister and one of this brothers, who was his twin brother. Jad along with his syblings were raised in Abu Dhabi by their parents, who had immigrated there in the mid 90s. Jad and all his syblings all attended the same primary and middle school from Kg 1 till grade 6. Then, when each sybling's respective time came, all syblings transfered to the same highscool in grade 7 untill they graduated. </p>

            <div id="Friends">

             </div>

             <p style="color:;text-align:center;"> Up until Jad moved schools in grade 7, he always had a shifting friedns group. A lot of friends but no one to call a bestfriend. However, once he moved to highscool, he met some poeple that turned to be some of his bestfriends ever. Some of these friends even came with him to the same university, even though a lot of other people tried to convince us frineds to go to separate universities, however, jad and his friends had the time of their lives together, untill covid-19 forced everyone to quaratine and move back to the UAE. </p>
