  <p> In this section, we will talk about where and what Jad has learnt in his 20 years of life. When Jad was young, he was considered not every smart. Young Jad was also somewhat of a trouble maker. Once Jad's mom found out that Jad's classmates call him the class clown, she got every angry at her son to the point where Jad started behaving properly in class. While growing up, Jad always wanted to become a doctor in the future, and that dream was alive up untill grade 10. In grade 10, when Jad
  had to replace his P.E lessons for the biology class, he stuck with biology to try to keep his dream alive. However, Jad quickly noticed that he would rather be active and play sports than sit in a class for two hours, and from that point onwards, Jad dropped the biology class and returned to the P.E classes, which made him a lot happier.</p>

<p> Coming from a family filled with engineers, Jad knew that it was his destiny to became an engineer. After his first year of university, Jad picked to pursue Gepmatics Engineering and is currently on track to finish his degree. </p>

              <div class="col-3">
                Doing his best
              </div>

      <p> Jad was taught patience from his monther, who always told an arabic proverb that says "God is with the patient", and due to that phrase, Jad always trys to apply patience in ever factor of his life. Prayer is another pillar that Jad cannot go without. Additionally, Jad's parents always told him, from when he was young, that as long as Jad did his best, they would always be proud of him, and that is what drives Jad to do his best. </P>
