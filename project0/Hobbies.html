        <p> In this section, we will dig into Jad's hobbies. Jad enjoys playing sports and being athletic. Having grown up with three other brothers and a father who loves sports, Jad naturally grew up loving playing sports. The sports that Jad mainly played when he was growing up include:  </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Soccer</li>
          <li>Basketball</li>
          <li>Squash</li>
          <li>Tennis</li>
          <li>Swimming</li>
        </ul>
        <p> When Jad was in highscool, after trying out for the varsity basketball team, he was asked to join the squad and play for his high school basketball team. However, Jad's favorite sport is and has always been football(soccer). Growing up Jad loved watching Real Madrid play and conqure Europe, coincidentally watching Real Madrid play week in week out made Jad love Cristiano Ronaldo, and he soon became Jad's all time favorite player. And in Jad's opinion, he would tell you the Cristano Ronaldo is the greatest football (soccer) player that has ever played the game.

     <p> Though Jad is usully every busy with his studying and working, he still tries to stay as active as he can by playing pickup football games, and pickup basektball games on the weekends or whenever he can. Jad also loves playing squash and tennis, due to his father's love for those sports, however Jad does not have too many friends to play squsah or tennis against, so it became hard for Jad to practice those sports.
