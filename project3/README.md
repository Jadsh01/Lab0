I have designed the new map layer to be visually applying to the human eye. At first glance, users will notice that the main background color is beige-grey rather than white. Also, the color for all water attributes is a darker shade of blue than usual, as well as the Greenspace color being a darker shade of green when compared to the old map. This is done to reduce the brightness of the previous colors, such that users have an easier time spotting different elements of the map. Additionally, I adjusted the colors of the text, that appear on the map, such that there is a contrast between the background color and the text color, and I made sure to differentiate between the different types of text. As for symbols, I added the transit symbol onto the map, as I believe that is an important factor of a good map.

As for the Data-driven circles, I tried styling the circles so that they are visible even if the user is fully zoomed out. First, I adjusted the radius, I changed the circle radius and switched the rate of change from linear to step. I found that those changes helped make the data-circles more size appropriate for our map. Secondly, I set the circle blur value to 0.5, such that our data-circles have more shading around the edges, making the circles more visible. Then, by adjusting the circle opacity to 0.8, the data-circles become more defined and neater. Finally, by changing the stroke width to 0.75 px, that will adjust the width of the circles.
