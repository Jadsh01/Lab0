# Project 1

ENGO 551

In this lab, we needed to create a website that allows users to search for books, within the books.csv file, on the website using pyhton, flask , and SQL. On the website, users are able to create a new account by registoring and then logging in. Once logged in, users are able to use the search engine to search for books using their ISBN id, title, or author. Once the book decriptions are entered, users are taken to the books page, which displays the book's information.
